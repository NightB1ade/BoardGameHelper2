# NightB1ade’s Board Game Helper

A little GitHub Pages website for myself to aid in the setup and play of my board (and card) games.  This utilises the Board Game Geek API to pull some additional data (e.g. thumbnails).  Most of the other parts of this have been written by myself.  I eventually intend to use the XML in the background to also drive other applications (possibly an android app version).

I have not currently added a licence to this as this is intended for my personal use.  If however, you have managed to stumble here and would like to contribute or utilise the resources, I would be happy to help and look to change that.  Please contact me and I’ll look to add a licence at that point.

I do not own any of the copyright for any of these games and these are nowhere near full games.  The information on this website are just reminders and crib sheets.  I am happy to remove the relevant areas of information when requested by the relevant people.
